## Requirements
2. Use HTML5 / SCSS / ES6
3. Make it responsive using your best judgement.
4. Create a simple custom overlay for photos - use only vanilla JavaScript, do not use jQuery or any other external libraries for it.
5. Create some hover effect for the image thumbnails.
6. Make the page the smallest possible size - ensure that images are properly optimized, resources minified, etc.
7. Make semantic, small sized commits of the changes you've made. Make sure each commit expressed the changes you've made. Avoid single large commits if possible.

## Installation
1. cd to `app`
2. run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. run `gulp serve` to start developing

## Supported browsers
Ensure that the elements work and display correctly in the following browsers:

- Firefox (latest version)
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer 11

## Coding Standards
When working on the project use consistent coding style. Try to follow what's already defined in Chisel (EditorConfig, stylelint, ESLint). You can also check guidelines like [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co/) or [CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/).

## Project Deadline
Do your best to complete the project, but limit your time to 4-6 hours. At very least I want to see samples of your code on each of the 3 languages (HTML, CSS & JS).

## Quality Assurance

What you need to do to get high QA score? Simply answer **Yes** to all these questions:

### General
